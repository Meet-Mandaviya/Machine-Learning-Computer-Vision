Let's take a look at a scenario where we can recognize different items of clothing, trained from a dataset containing 10 different types.
We will train a neural network to recognize items of clothing from a common dataset called Fashion MNIST. It contains 70,000 items of clothing in 10 different categories. Each item of clothing is in a 28x28 greyscale image.
